      <hr />
      straight to the point, in my opinion, the christian faith is a big joke.
      how can you unironically say that your god is 3 but 1? how can you say
      your god has become a man, and has went to the toilet, eaten, drank, got
      ill, and reduced his power? this is simply foolish. your god wasn't even
      all knowing. <br /><br />in mark 13:32 it reads "But about that day or
      hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only
      the Father." so your god doesn't even have knowledge? what kind of weak
      god is this. <br /><br />jesus (peace be upon him) is a great man, a man
      with many miracles. the average muslim loves jesus more than the average
      christian, we believe jesus was an amazing man, one who believed in his
      lord, and did not ever claim to be the son of god. he is simply a prophet
      and a messenger sent by allah, born from the virgin mary, a man blessed
      with many miracles, even the bible says this in some verses.
      <br /><br />and to those who claim that the eyewitnesses of jesus clearly
      heard that jesus claimed to be god. allow me to ask you this: who is
      matthew? who is mark? who is luke? who is john? <br />do you know their
      last names? who are their parents? how old were they when they died?
      nobody knows anything about these 'eyewitnesses'. not to mention the
      countless contradictions they recorded in their corrupted bible, such as
      the age of ahazaiah. <br /><br />shame on you for accusing the most
      merciful of taking a son, it does not befit him to take a son.
      <br /><br />They1 say, “The Most Compassionate has offspring.” [19:88]
      <br /><br />You have certainly made an outrageous claim, [19:89]
      <br /><br />by which the heavens are about to burst, the earth to split
      apart, and the mountains to crumble to pieces [19:90] <br /><br />in
      protest of attributing children to the Most Compassionate. [18:91]
      <br /><br />It does not befit ˹the majesty of˺ the Most Compassionate to
      have children. [18:92]
