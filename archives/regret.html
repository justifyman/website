      <hr />
      i saw a video earlier today where a guy was saying something along the
      lines of - imagine you're 80 years old, sitting with your grandchildren
      and family, and you open netflix and the only movie on netflix is the
      movie of your life, would you be entertained by the movie? just seeing
      yourself doing absolutely nothing for 12 hours a day? the answer should be
      no, obviously. <br /><br />and this is such a big problem that i'm seeing
      everywhere, and i'm not one to be picking on others for doing this, as i'm
      guilty of it too, very guilty, so hopefully we both learn through this -
      you and me, reader. <br /><br />there's a certain kid in my class who i
      see doing nothing all day but just watching cringey youtube shorts on his
      tablet, the only time he isn't watching yt shorts is when the teacher gets
      fed up and takes his tablet, at that point he gets really mad and
      defensive and tries to take it back by force. this honestly just makes me
      sad. imagine being the parent, seeing your child wasting all their time,
      knowing that they will <b>regret</b> their decisions in the future.
      <br /><br />i am also guilty of scrolling on my phone for extended periods
      of time, wasting it all away. the hours and hours and hours i've spent on
      my phone doing useless things could've been spent on learning a useful
      skill, or getting some new knowledge, or just preparing myself for my
      future. i regret wasting those hours. <br /><br />while it may seem
      harmless in the moment, these habits can lead to profound regret in the
      future. every minute spent on trivial pursuits is a minute lost in
      potential growth and development. the regret may arise when they realize
      that the hours wasted away could have been dedicated to learning new
      skills, exploring passions, or fostering meaningful relationships. in
      hindsight, they may lament the missed opportunities and wish they had
      invested their time more wisely during their formative years. it's
      essential to instill in children the importance of mindful time management
      and the value of investing in activities that nourish their minds and
      souls. <br /><br />so for you and i, reader. let's try to put our time to
      more useful things in the coming times.
