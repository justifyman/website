      <h1 style="font-size: xx-large">The Dajjal.</h1>
      <hr />
      the dajjal, in sunni islam, is a significant eschatological figure, often
      referred to as the "false messiah" or "antichrist." he is believed to be a
      major sign of the end times. <br /><br />
      the term "dajjal" is not explicitly mentioned in the quran, there are
      several hadiths in both sahih bukhari and sahih muslim that describe him
      in detail. dajjal is literally translated to 'the deceiver'. according to
      these hadiths, the dajjal is described as a human-like figure with one
      eye. <br /><br />
      narrated from Ibn ‘Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) that the
      Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) mentioned
      the Dajjal to the people and said: “Allah is not one-eyed, but the false
      messiah (al-Masih al-Dajjal) is one-eyed, blind or defective in his right
      eye, with his eye looking like a floating grape…” (narrated by al-Bukhari,
      no. 3184). <br /><br />
      in the lengthy hadith narrated by al-Nawwas ibn Sam’an (may Allah be
      pleased with him) it says: the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of
      Allah be upon him) mentioned the Dajjal one morning. Sometimes he
      described him as insignificant and sometimes he described him as so
      significant that we thought that he was in the cluster of date-palm
      trees…” One of the features of the Dajjal that he described was: “He will
      be a young man with very curly hair, with his eye floating. It is as if he
      looks like ‘Abd al-‘Uzza ibn Qatan.” (Narrated by Muslim, no. 5228)
      <br /><br />
      according to the hadith of Anas (may Allah be pleased with him), the
      Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said: “No Prophet was
      sent but he warned his people about the one-eyed liar. He is one-eyed, but
      your Lord is not one-eyed, and between his eyes will be written ‘kafir.’”
      (Narrated by al-Bukhari, no. 6598). According to another report: “Written
      between his eyes will be ‘kaf fa ra.’” (Muslim, no. 5219) According to a
      report narrated by Hudhayfah, “This will be read by every believer,
      literate or illiterate.” (Muslim, no. 5223). <br /><br />
      he will emerge during a time of great turmoil and chaos, claiming to be a
      prophet and performing deceptive miracles to mislead people. he will
      possess extraordinary powers, including the ability to control the weather
      and resurrect the dead. the prophet muhammad (peace be upon him) warned
      his followers about the dajjal's deception and urged them to seek refuge
      in allah's protection. he emphasized the importance of knowing allah's
      names and attributes to recognize the dajjal's falsehood. the prophet also
      advised believers to recite the first ten verses of surah al-kahf (18th
      chapter of the quran) as protection against the dajjal's tribulations.
      while the dajjal is portrayed as a powerful and ominous figure, islamic
      tradition teaches that his reign of deception will ultimately be defeated
      by the return of jesus christ (isa ibn maryam), who will kill him at the
      gate of ludd (a place in palestine). this event will mark the triumph of
      truth over falsehood and the establishment of justice and righteousness on
      earth. the concept of the dajjal serves as a reminder for muslims to
      remain steadfast in their faith and vigilant against deception and
      falsehood. it underscores the importance of seeking knowledge, adhering to
      the teachings of islam, and relying on allah's guidance and protection in
      times of trial and tribulation. <br /><br />
      there is much more information about the dajjal that i have not mentioned
      here, i highly recommend you read the quran and hadiths to learn more.
