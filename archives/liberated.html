      <hr />
      if you've been in some parts of the internet, or you live in the western
      world, notably USA and Canada, you may have realized a few things. this
      whole 'liberation' thing, it's a huge danger. <br /><br />nowadays you
      have men dressing like women, women dressing like men, and nudity is
      widespread. i have no doubt that if this continues in many nations, this
      will ultimately destroy said nations. <br /><br />Salahuddin Al-Ayyubi,
      one of the greatest warriors in the 12th century stated: "If you want to
      destroy any nation without war, make adultery and nudity common in the
      next generation." and he's absolutely right. look at the western world
      today. men are fragile, weak, unable to even care for themselves. they are
      enslaved to their desires and trying to stand out because they get no
      better attention. they are promoting sodomy, nudity, and their twisted
      idea of 'freedom'. it's freedom only until you slightly disagree with
      them. <br /><br />you might ask "what's so wrong with a dude trying to be
      a woman?" the biggest issue is that you are going against what god has
      willed for you, what god has decided for you, what god thinks is best for
      you. you are simply weakening yourself, you are enslaving yourself to your
      own desires. <br /><br />they are deluding themselves into thinking they
      are right, but statistically they are ultimately wrong. trans suicide
      rates across countries range from 32% to 50%, and 82% think about suicide.
      they are depressed, they are not pleased, they dont want this. but this is
      what the modern world has made them think. they could say "well it's
      because we're not accepted!" they ARE accepted, they have an entire month
      dedicated to pleasing them and loving them and caring for them, and if you
      dont you're labeled as a homophobic stupid bigot who cant respect others
      choices, ironic right?
