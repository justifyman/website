      <h1 style="font-size: xx-large">A Day Their Mouths Will Be Sealed.</h1>
      <hr />
      the day of judgement, it is known by many names such us the day of
      resurrection, the day of reckoning, etc. <br /><br />
      the day of judgement is a day of fear for all, a day where their mouths
      will be sealed, and their parts will testify what they used to commit.
      <br /><br />
      On this Day We will seal their mouths, their hands will speak to Us, and
      their feet will testify to what they used to commit. [36:65] <br /><br />
      the criminals, the sinners, the wrongdoers, the disbelievers, they will
      all suffer intense hardship and thirst, and experience extreme fear,
      because they will stand for such a long time and will be certain that they
      will be brought to account, and they will wonder with what Allah, may He
      be Glorified and Exalted, will requite them. <br /><br />
      the day of reckoning wont age like a normal 24 hour day, it will last
      thousands and thousands of years. on this day, every single human that has
      ever lived will gather, every single sin of those who disbelieved will be
      shown. the final decision is whether you go to jahannam (the hellfire), or
      jannah (the paradise). the kuffar will be thrown into the hellfire, to
      burn for eternity, filled with regret and remorse. <br /><br />
      Losers indeed are those who deny the meeting with Allah until the Hour
      takes them by surprise, then they will cry, “Woe to us for having ignored
      this!” They will bear ˹the burden of˺ their sins on their backs. Evil
      indeed is their burden! [6:31] <br /><br />one might find these funny,
      thinking "how might my hands speak! how might my legs testify! impossible,
      simply impossible." do you think that god almighty is incapable of doing
      everything? allah is capable of everything, he is all knowing, all seeing,
      all hearing. if allah made the entire universe with such precise
      calculations, and made the human so perfectly, would you think he wouldn't
      be able to simply make things testify? <br /><br />
      And say, "The truth is from your Lord, so whoever wills - let him believe;
      and whoever wills - let him disbelieve." Indeed, We have prepared for the
      wrongdoers a fire whose walls will surround them. And if they call for
      relief, they will be relieved with water like murky oil, which scalds
      [their] faces. Wretched is the drink, and evil is the resting place.
      [18:29] <br /><br />on the day, the believers will be entered into
      paradise, they will have everything they ask for, anything they want,
      everything they want, whatever they desire, they'll have it. their
      happiness will never be extinguished, they will never get sick, nor tired,
      nor sleepy, it will just be pure happiness, unlike the disbelievers.
      <br /><br />i have only mentioned a tiny part of the information allah and
      his prophet have given to us about the day of judgement. read the quran
      and hadiths for more information.
